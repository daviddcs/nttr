# Airspace Control Plan

## ACP MAP 
### [NSST Combat Flite Overlay](/NavAids/NSST_CF.cf)

## MRR (Minimum Risk Routes)
All MRR transits are to be flown at 1 000FT intervals.  
Altitude transitions within MRR is prohibited.  

**MRR BASE SEPARATION.  
NORTHBOUND: EVEN 1 000 FT INCREMENTS (120,180)  
SOUTHBOUND: ODD 1 000 FT INCREMENTS (130,190)**

## ELEVATORS
Designated altitude transition areas, marked on ACO map overlay as "Elevator" or "*ELEV*"  
Types:  
*  CentreGrid Elevator marked dot and diameter on map.
*  Corridor Elevator marked with routing corridor on map.

**ELEV BASE SEPARATION.  
CENTREGRID: CLIMB IN LEFTHAND PATTERN AROUND CENTER POINT.  
CENTREGRID: DECEND IN RIGHTHAND PATTERN AROUND CENTER POINT.  
CORRIDORELEV: AS PER MAP ANNOTAION, NORMALLY "UP/DOWN"**  

## CSG7 - CCA
Carrier Strike Group 7 Carrier Control Area extends 40 nm from CSG7, as the location is dynamic be prepared to respond to auth. req. and possible escorts if transiting the CCA.


## Tanker Operations
All AAR tracks are flown at ,500FT.  Exercise caution when rejoining with a tanker operating within an MRR.  IMC rejoins must be performed under radar control.  

## Killboxes
Two set's of killboxes are currently in effect.  
- Letter Number Box (X9)  
- Letter Letter Box (XX)

X9 boxes measure 20x18nm (HxW) and are available in the navigation database with a centre-grid reference.  
XX boxes measure 30x27nm (HxW) these are available on the planning map as an overlay.
