#  Air Defence Doctrine

The Air Defences are operating in accordance with the following Doctrine:


The REDFOR have a well developed Integrated Air Defence System (IADS).

The IADS consist of 2 primary elements. Where one is the A-A fighters located at primary airbases, and the second is the Surface to Air missile's.

IADS consists of Early Warning Radar's (EWR's) that support both elements with early warning.

Around the most critical infrastructure, such as important airbases, a Air Defence Brigade consisting of SA-10 and SA-11 is deployed to provide necessary area defence to 
protect other parts of the IADS, especially the A-A fighters.

Around key cities or military installations, various fixed sites of larger SAM's such as SA-2 and HAWK is deployed.  All static sites is assessed to be protected by smaller SAM's to prevent low-flying aircraft from attacking the larger SAM's.

For supporting the ground forces, the REDFOR primarily uses its Air Defence Battalions of SA-19, SA-13.



### Tactics
The REDFOR SAM's are reported to use various modes of operandi in order to increase it's lethality and make it harder for the coalition to operate:
- One tactic is to have smaller SAM's shut off, and only turned on when a potential target is in the weapon engagement zone of the SAM. 
- The entire network is likely not active at any given time, as the Iranians want to both hide and prevent Anti Radiation Missiles (ARM's) to be able to neutralize their radars.
- The REDFOR mobile SAM's is also known for shooting, and then moving to a new location to prevent being targeted by SEAD/DEAD forces.
